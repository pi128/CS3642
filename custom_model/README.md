# 🎸 Custom Guitar Transcription Model

This directory contains a hand-rolled custom model for guitar transcription, designed to improve upon the existing CREPE-based system.

## 🎯 Goals

- **Better chord recognition** - More accurate chord detection
- **Improved pitch estimation** - Better frequency-to-fret mapping
- **Faster processing** - Optimized for real-time or batch processing
- **Guitar-specific** - Tailored specifically for guitar audio characteristics

## 🧠 Model Architecture Ideas

### 1. **Multi-Stage Pipeline**
- **Stage 1**: Audio preprocessing and feature extraction
- **Stage 2**: Pitch estimation with guitar-specific tuning
- **Stage 3**: Chord recognition using harmonic analysis
- **Stage 4**: Tablature mapping with confidence scoring

### 2. **Guitar-Specific Features**
- **String resonance modeling** - Account for string harmonics
- **Fret position optimization** - Better frequency-to-fret mapping
- **Chord voicing recognition** - Detect different chord inversions
- **Strumming pattern analysis** - Identify attack patterns

### 3. **Technical Approaches**
- **Deep learning** - CNN/RNN for feature extraction
- **Signal processing** - Advanced FFT and spectral analysis
- **Machine learning** - SVM/Random Forest for classification
- **Hybrid approach** - Combine multiple techniques
