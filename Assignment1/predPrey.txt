The shark has to turn slowly and speed up when really close to the school he just attacks the mass then maybe singles out a fish.

The fish love to spiral by turning towards a center mass.

It should be only the closest fish panic because of the shark and the neighbor fish just react to the others impeding their space 

This will be built using GO compiling with Tiny-GO to make it a .wasm 

Hopefully can port to WilI, also on website

addControlPictureFromFile(panel, controlIndex, x, y, "filename", visible)

use vectors for map 

possibly objects like reef on the edges

The fish motion in this project is based on established models of collective behavior. In particular, I borrowed from Aoki (1982) and Reynolds’ ‘Boids’ model (1987), where forces of attraction, repulsion, and alignment are treated as potential-like influences. My ‘comfort potential’ framing is a reinterpretation of those same forces, inspired by more recent SDE approaches (Hartono et al. 2022) and the predator–prey dynamics discussed by Couzin et al. (2005)

Separation, Allignment, Cohesion all taken from the Complexity_International paper, I added the tangential spiral so because I though it would look cool. The shark moves using the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process it sounded really cool and also got the affect I wanted of a meandering but also slight attraction to the school.
