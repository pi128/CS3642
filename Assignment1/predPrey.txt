The shark has to turn slowly and speed up when really close to the school he just attacks the mass then maybe singles out a fish.

The fish love to spiral by turning towards a center mass.

It should be only the closest fish panic because of the shark and the neighbor fish just react to the others impeding there space 

This will be built using GO compiling with Tiny-GO to make it a .wasm 

Hopefully can port to WilI, also on website
